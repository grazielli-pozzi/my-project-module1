Checkers Game

Introduction

It’s a reproduction of the game called checkers. It was the first project at my Web Development Bootcamp (Ironhack Brazil).

Game rules

The standard game rules are the following ones:
- The boarder has a dimension 8x8;
-The boarder has black and white spots, but only the black spots are occupied by pieces;
- When it’s the team turn, it can move only one of its pieces.
- The pieces can do only a diagonal movement;
- Each team plays alternately;
- Both teams need to follow a specific direction. They cannot turn back. The goal for each piece is to reach the opposite border of the board;
- Pieces are removed from the board when a piece encounters a piece of the opposite team in front of it and there is a place empty in front of the opposite team piece. The piece can jump the opposite team piece and then the team that jumped will receive one point in its score. The team that loses all the pieces first will be the defeated;
- The goal for each team is to eliminate all the pieces of the opposite team from the boarder;
- When a team reaches the opposite boarder (last position available), it receives an opposite piece as part of it and becomes a super piece. That super piece is able to move diagonally in the boarder and eliminates the opposite pieces that eventually are in that diagonal.

The following rules are the ones that have been applied to my project:
- The boarder has a dimension 8x8;
-The boarder has black and white spots, but only the black spots are occupied by pieces;
- When it’s the team turn, it can move only one of its pieces.
- The pieces can do only a diagonal movement;
- Each team plays alternately;
- Both teams need to follow a specific direction. They cannot turn back. The goal for each piece is to reach the opposite border of the board;
- Pieces are removed from the board when a piece encounters a piece of the opposite team in front of it and there is a place empty in front of the opposite team piece. The piece can jump the opposite team piece and then the team that jumped will receive one point in its score. The team that loses all the pieces first will be the defeated;
- The goal for each team is to eliminate all the pieces of the opposite team from the boarder.

Points to improvement

It was not implement in that project the step that allows the piece to become a super piece when it reaches the opposite boarder.
The design of the game can be certainly improved a lot.
